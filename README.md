This is my first VHDL project, and I'm starting off with a big one, a design for a computing fabric, the BitGrid.

I've been playing with the ideas in my head for decades now. It's time to put them into code, first in an FPGA, then into silicon.

The main question is, how efficient is this architecture, compared to high speed asics, etc?

Time will tell.

The compiler/simulator I'm running as of January 2024 is 

Questa Intel Starter FPGA Edition-64 2023.3
Revision: 2023.07
Date: Jul 17 2023

I don't have an FPGA to try this out on yet

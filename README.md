This is my first VHDL project, and I'm starting off with a big one, a design for a computing fabric, the BitGrid.

I've been playing with the ideas in my head for decades now. It's time to put them into code, first in an FPGA, then into silicon.

The main question is, how efficient is this architecture, compared to high speed asics, etc?

Time will tell.
